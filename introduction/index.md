## Introduction

> Programming is resource management.  
> **Ruchira Bomiriya**

There are four vital pillars in designing a programming language.

* A clear grasp (definition) of the fundamental abstract computing machine.
* A congruent semantics that allows derived higher level abstractions.
* A terminology for the core and extensions that is intuitive.
* A crisp syntax for expressing program design.

A program is machine that manages resources to fulfill intended purposes.
There are four primary resources that a program manages:
***knowledge***, ***labor***, ***space*** and ***time***.

A programming language needs to provide a one-to-one mapping for
managing these resources.
If we achieve congruent semantics, it would be possible to
build higher level abstractions that captures computing constructs
at high-fidelity.

The resulting programs would also achieve high performance.
